This Chrome Extension fixes this annoying behavior and disables the scroll on the calendar grid in Google Calendar. You won't be able to navigate to next/previous month using the scroll. You will have to use the arrows `<` `>` buttons, as normal people expect it to be.

## Installation

1. Download `gcsd.crx` from the _releases_ folder
2. Navigate to Google Chrome -> Settings -> Extentions
3. Drag and Drop `gcsd.crx` from your download folder to _Extension_ screen
4. Accept to install _Google Calendar Scroll Disabler_ and reload Google Calendar page
